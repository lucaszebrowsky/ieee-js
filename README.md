 # IEEE Standard Implementations in Javascript

This repository contains implementations of various IEEE standards in Javascript.

> **Originally made for IoT platforms** like [Datacake](https://datacake.de/) and [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), to be used in **payload decoders** for sensor data. The goal is to provide accurate, spec-faithful, bit-level implementations that can be used for learning, testing, or reference purposes.
